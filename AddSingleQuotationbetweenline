To add single quoation in the beginning of each line and a single quoation in the end including comma:
# sed -E "s/^/'/;s/\r?$/',/" file
Or
# sed -E "s/^([0-9]+)\r?$/'\1',/" ttt.txt

NOTE: This works for MS notepad file with \r as linebreak and last line with \n as line break (thus the \r? in the regex).
